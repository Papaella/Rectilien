# Privacy Policy for Rectilien

**Effective Date:** 27/11/2024

Rectilien ("the Bot") is designed to enhance your Discord experience by replacing URLs in messages as specified by server administrators. We take your privacy seriously and are committed to safeguarding the data handled by the Bot.

## 1. Information We Collect
Rectilien requires access to certain types of data to function effectively. Specifically:

- **Message Content**: Rectilien processes message content to identify URLs and replace them according to the server's configuration. No message data is stored or retained outside of Discord's servers.
- **Server and Channel Information**: The Bot accesses server and channel IDs to identify where it should operate.

## 2. Permissions Required
To perform its functions, Rectilien requires the following Discord permissions:

- **Manage Messages**: This allows the Bot to delete messages containing URLs and replace them with the updated versions as per the server settings.
- **Send Messages**: This allows the Bot to send replacement messages with the updated URLs.

## 3. How We Use the Information
The information accessed by Rectilien is used solely to perform its intended functionality of replacing URLs in messages. The Bot does **not**:

- Log, store, or share any message content or user data.
- Access or process any data beyond what is necessary for its functionality.

## 4. Data Retention
Rectilien does not store or retain any user data. All processing occurs in real-time and within Discord's environment.

## 5. Third-Party Sharing
Rectilien does not share any data with third parties.

## 6. User Control
Server administrators can control the Bot's permissions and functionality by managing its role and command settings within Discord. Removing the Bot from a server will immediately terminate its access to server data.

## 7. Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted here, with the "Effective Date" updated accordingly.
